# Contrib

This directory contains unmaintained, unsupported, and unorganized contributions by the Owncast community.

It is a place to put scripts, config files and examples that might be useful to share with others without expectation that they're an official part of the project.

[Read Drew DeVault's description of the contrib directory](https://drewdevault.com/2020/06/06/Add-a-contrib-directory.html) for details and background.
