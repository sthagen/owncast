Owncast is a straightforward web application and compared to many projects is very easy to get running locally and contributing to.

- The backend is written in [Go](https://go.dev/).
- The frontend is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/).

If you're interested in contributing to Owncast, here's how you can get started.

## How to start with Frontend development

The web frontend of Owncast is written in React with TypeScript built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

You can browse the React components in the project using our [Storybook](https://owncast.online/components) page to get an idea of how the frontend is structured.

1. Fork the Owncast repository on Github located at https://github.com/owncast/owncast.
1. Check out your fork locally with `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/owncast`.
1. Create a new branch for your new changes with `git checkout -b my-new-feature`.

### Run the web project

1. Change to the `web` directory and install dependencies with `npm install`.
1. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

You must have an instance of Owncast running locally to connect to. You can run one with `go run main.go` from the root of the repository. Read more details about running development Owncast under the backend section.

### Learn about how to write React Components with Owncast

We have a [short document](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/blob/web/components/_COMPONENT_HOW_TO.md) outlining the specifics of the hows and whys of our specific component approach.

### Use Storybook to update and create components

Storybook is a tool that allows you to create and test components in isolation. It's a great way to develop new components and test them out without running a copy of the Owncast server.

1. Run `npm run storybook` to start the Storybook server.
1. Open `http://localhost:6006` in your browser.
1. Navigate the Storybook interface to browse and test components.

## How to start with Backend development

The backend of Owncast is written in Go. It operates as a web and API server, inbound RTMP ingestion server, outbound HLS distribution server, and chat server.

1. Ensure you have the [Go programming language](https://go.dev/dl/) tools installed for your system.
1. Clone the Owncast repository with `git clone https://github.com/owncast/owncast`.
1. A c compiler and tooling must be available on your system. Generally this means installing `gcc` and its development libraries.
1. Run `go run main.go` from the root of the repository.

### Go Linting

We use golangci-lint to lint our Go code. While optional, it is a useful tool to assist you in writing better Go code. You can install it from the [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/#local-installation) website.

## Run a development stream

Many features are only enabled when a stream is live. You can run a local stream using any video file you have around by running:

```bash
./test/ocTestStream.sh somevideofile.mp4
```
